Implementing **Semgrep** with **GitHub SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** involves setting up Semgrep as part of your CI/CD pipeline (via GitHub Actions) to scan your code for security issues and report them as part of GitHub's **Code Scanning Alerts**.

Here are the **full steps** to integrate Semgrep with GitHub SAST:

## Step 1: Create a Semgrep Account

Semgrep offers a free and paid tier. Creating an account allows you to:

- Access prebuilt rule sets
- Get centralized dashboards
- Manage policies across teams
- Store scan results

### To create a Semgrep account:

1. Go to https://semgrep.dev
2. Click **Sign Up** (top-right)
3. Choose a signup method:
    - GitHub
    - GitLab
    - Email/password
4. Follow the instructions to complete signup.

---

## Step 2: Create or Choose a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. Create a new repository:
    - Click the **+** icon > **New repository**
    - Set a name, e.g., `my-app`
    - Choose public or private
    - Click **Create repository**
  ---

### Step 1: Get Your Semgrep App Token (API Key)

1. Go to https://semgrep.dev
2. Log in to your Semgrep Cloud account.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Settings** > **API Keys** (or go directly to: https://semgrep.dev/org/settings)
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Give it a name, e.g., `github-action-key`
6. Copy the generated token (you will only see it once).

### Step 2: Store the Token in GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`
5. Value: *Paste the API key you copied from Semgrep*

---

### Step 3: Update Your GitHub Workflow to Use the Token

Update your `semgrep.yml` workflow to include authentication:

> You can also use an existing repo.
Below is a simple GitHub Actions workflow YAML that runs Semgrep with authentication:

**https://github.com/jeetCl/semgrep/blob/master/.github/workflows/semgrep.yml**

### Explanation:

- `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` → store this in **GitHub Secrets** (`Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret`).
- `semgrep ci` → runs a scan and uploads results to the **Semgrep App** dashboard.
- Triggered on every push and pull request to `main`.

## Project Linking

To link a specific repo to a Semgrep Project:

1. In Semgrep Cloud, go to **Projects**
2. Click **Add Project**
3. Connect your GitHub org (if not already connected)
4. Choose the repository you want to monitor
5. You can now enforce org-level rules and manage scan policies centrally.

## Trigger a Scan

After pushing:

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click on **Actions**
3. You’ll see a workflow named **Semgrep** 
4. Wait for it to complete

## View Results on Semgrep Cloud

After setting up the secret and pushing your workflow:

1. Go to https://semgrep.dev
2. Click on **Projects**
3. Your GitHub repo will appear if results were uploaded.
4. You can see:
    - Security issues
    - Custom policies
    - Rule violations
    - Scan history
